# Deploy contracts

> *NOTE: ```deploy``` command is still under active development and currently only supported in MacOS*

Once you have successfully compiled your contracts, make sure to fill out the necessary instantiation message information under the `init` field in the `jenesis.toml` file, you can deploy your contracts. 

> *Note: `jenesis deploy` currently requires that each contract's directory name matches the `.wasm` file name under the `artifacts` directory.

To deploy all the contracts inside a profile you have two options: 

1. Fill the `deployer_key` field for each contract inside the `jenesis.toml` file (keys can be different for each contract) and run the following command:

```
jenesis alpha deploy --profile profile_name
```
Each contract inside the specified profile will be deployed with the specified key.

2. Simply specify a certain key as an argument of the deploy command:

```
jenesis alpha deploy key_name --profile profile_name 
```

The `deployer_key` field will be ignored in this case and all contracts inside the specified profile will be deployed using the key `key_name`.

After running either of the commands mentioned above, all the deployment information will be saved in the `jenesis.lock` file inside your project's directory
